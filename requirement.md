# Requirements

When the game started, the board should be empty.

* Two players take turn to place at a block.
* The circle side player takes the first turn.

* There are rules of block placement:
    - the place should be empty. (Haven't been occupied)
    - if there's a 3-connect along any row, column, left diagonal or right diagonal,
    the player immediately wins, and the game is over.
    - if all the blocks have been placed but no player wins, then the game is over with a Tie.
